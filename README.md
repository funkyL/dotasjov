# dotasjov

Simple project created to help me learn some vue.js.
Basicly what it does is take a json file containing information about picks and winrates for all heroes in the popular moba game Dota 2.
You select the heroes your oppenent has picked so far, and the script will show you each hero's accumulated winrate against the selected hereos.

It's not made pretty, but practical and for my learning purposes.

Dota is the name of the game, sjov is a danish word meaning fun. Hence dotasjov.
